# a-not-really-captcha-captcha

A not really captcha, captcha. 

Goofy, quick, project that popped into my head. 

Made pretty quickly after I thought about it after doing a captcha. Thinking of adding one more goofy feature. 

Wanted to make it single file, with no classes. 

Fun little project. And obviously, and robot could solve this one easy.
